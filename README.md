# NO_SHOW APPOINTMENTS DATA ANALYSIS
## Dataset Description
This dataset collects information from 110527 medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in the dataset.

The dataset has 13 columns to mention a few;

PatientID which indicates the ID of the patient,AppointmentID which indicates the appointment ID of the patient,Gender, ScheduledDay which tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment,Neighborhood which indicates the location of the hospital and Scholarship which indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. The last column named No-show means ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
## Question(s) for Analysis
What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
Number of patients that did not show up for the appointment
Number of patients that showed up for the appointment
Does age predict if the patient will show up or not?
Does scholarship predict whether the patient will show up?
Does Hipertension predict whether the patient will show up
Does Diabetes predict whether the patient will show up?
Does Alcoholism predict whether the patient will show up?
Does being Handcapped predict whether the patient will show up?
Does SMS_received predict whether the patient will show up?
Does Gender predict if a patient will show up for the scheduled appointment?
Does Neighbourhood predict if a patient will show up for the scheduled appointment?
Does gender determines if one has Hipertension?
Does gender determine if one has diabetes?
## Conclusions
The most important question of th e project was what factors are important for us to know inorder to predict if the will show up for the scheduled appointment or not. The dataset had fourteen columns but 8 of them were considered. The 8 factors are to be considered to know which ones can predict whether a patient is gonna show up for the appointment or not.

For scholarship factor, patients who benefit from the Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família are not likely to show up for the appointment.
Patients with hipertension are more likely to show up for the appointment compared to patients with diabetes, alcoholism and the handcapped ones whose chances of showing up for the appointment are slightly lower.
Patients from PARQUE INDUSTRIAL neighbourhood are all likely to show up for the appointment but no patient from ILHAS OCEÂNICAS DE TRINDADE neighbourhood is likely to attend the appointment.
Patient's gender is not likely to affect the appointment show up.
Female patients are likely to have hipertension and diabetes.
Patients who received SMS are less likely to show up for the appointment.
This concludes that the important factors are scholarship,hipertension and neighbourhood where diabetes, alcoholism and handcap can also be used to predict whether the patient will show up or not.
